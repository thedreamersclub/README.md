# what is thedreamersclub?

<!-- `README to find out more!` -->

> TLDR: thedreamersclub takes creativity to heart; its founders want it to be a vehicle to realise their creative vision. We aim to develop and encourage a culture that supports creative pursuits. As John Fowles said, "All good science is art. And all good art is science."

<!-- The Dreamers Club like many of my projects (@le-bananafish) has taken on additional responsibilities and broadened its purpose. The original motivating project was to create an operating system that was fully extensible in a defined and modular way. That project was motivated by the belief that the "operating system" as a practical concept needed to accomodate new ideas and systems easier and faster than they currently are. The Dreamers Club would have been the vehicle of its realisation. -->

<!-- The intentions for this enterprise were later expanded as I started writing and became interested in the idea of assisting creatives (myself incl.) in getting their works published. The idea was that thedreamersclub would develop into a form of publishing house with its services offered in films, books, music and video games. This idea was deeply rooted in the belief that _original creators own the rights to their works_ and that only a published form of it would be owned dually by the creator and the publishing house. -->

<!-- The ideas behind how the enterprise have always been based on the idea of allowing people (me originally) to realise their dream projects and creative vision. This was motivated by my intention to develop an operating system being poorly received by my parents and eliciting confusing from laypeople. This idea was expanded when I started writing and further felt the pressure to defer our dreams for the sake of our financial stability. -->
